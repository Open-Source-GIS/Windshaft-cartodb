# It relies on a known format of the .js.example files which haven't
# been made easier to parse to still let humans copy them manually and
# do further editing or leave them as such to get the same setup as before
# the introduction of this script.
#
# The script is a work in progress. Available switches are printed
# by invoking with the --help switch. More switches will be added
# as the need/request for them arises.
